# Image Search App Using Unsplash API

## Overview
This project is a dynamic Image Search App that allows users to search for images by entering keywords. It leverages the Unsplash API to fetch relevant images and displays them in a responsive grid layout using CSS Grid or Flexbox. Clicking an image opens the full version in a new tab via its Unsplash link.

## Features
- **User Input & Search Functionality**: Enter keywords (e.g., "mountains", "dogs", "cars") and use the Enter key to trigger a search.
- **API Integration**: Fetches images from the Unsplash API based on the search term.
- **Responsive Display**: Uses CSS Grid or Flexbox to showcase image thumbnails in a responsive grid layout.
- **Clickable Images**: Each image, when clicked, opens in a new tab to display the full-sized image on Unsplash.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML5**: For structuring the application.
- **CSS3**: Utilizing CSS Grid or Flexbox for a modern, responsive design, also used Tailwind.
- **JavaScript (ES6+)**: For handling user input, API calls, and dynamic DOM updates.
- **Unsplash API**: To retrieve images based on search queries.
